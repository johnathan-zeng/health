The three validations included were: uniqueness, length, and presence. These were all located in the posts page.

We added Papertrail as a Heroku add-on.

For the queries, we created two queries: sorting descending by name, and displaying the most 3 recent posts Another two queries were created for a second list of posts: displaying posts with a latitude of 39.95 and hacing an offset.

The deployment location for posts is: https://cis196-jz-hq.herokuapp.com/
